\noindent \textbf{Response to the Referee: 2's comment}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\bf Major Comments}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The referee comments on, \comment{``System size dependence: The manuscript presents insightful results for a system size
				of N=8; however, a crucial aspect remains unexplored – the dependence of the
				findings on the system size. How do the observed dynamics and stability vary with an
				increase in system size?"}\\
		
		\response{
			We thank the referee for this suggestion. We have extended our investigation beyond system size N=8 . The results in figure(9) exhibits melting in DTC phase accompanied by beats at almost all possible spin interactions (defined by $\beta$) and coupling strengths in regional magnetization ($M^z_A$) curves in region A. To understand this melting in DTC observation, we have considered sizes N =4,6,8,10 and numerically calculated $M^z_A$ at and obtained corresponding FFTs for an extended time period upto $8 \times 10^4$T at DTC/DL point.  DTC/DL point is the first root of Bessel function of drive parameters $\frac{4h}{\omega}$. 
			
			We have numerically calculated the beats frequency for each case of $\beta$'s and spin coupling strengths (weak and strong) and plotted in figure(12) in revised manuscript. We observe that the beats frequency for each cases decreases with increase in system size N. This confirms that the stability of the DTC-DMBL chimeralike order increases with increase in N for all selected $\beta$'s and coupling strengths. At thermodynamic limit where $N\rightarrow\infty$, the corresponding beat frequency vanishes manifesting a perfectly stable chimeralike order. We have revised the manuscript describing dependence of findings on the system size in a subsection, titled ``4.3. System size dependent stability in chimeralike order'' in page no.19.

		\item The referee comments on, \comment{``Influence of rotational error $\epsilon_B$: The manuscript effectively investigates the
			impact of $\epsilon_A$={0.03,0.05,0.1} on the chimera states, leaving the role of $\epsilon_B$, set to 0.9, less discussed. How does varying $\epsilon_B$ impact the chimera
			states?"}\\
		
		\response{We thank the referee for pointing out the issue. We have considered additional rotation error $\epsilon_B = 0.6\; \&\; 0.8$ maintaining a constant value of $\epsilon_A = 0.03$. We have considered drive parameters at CDT/DL point and numerically calculated local magnetization $\expval{\hat{S}^z}$ for all $\beta$'s and spin coupling strengths in figure(7) in revised manuscript. We found that the DTC-DMBL order lacks stability at each cases. The stability of DMBL phase in region B decreases with increase in $\epsilon_B$. This does have direct proportional dominance over the stability of DTC phase in region A. Additionally we observed that the local magnetization in region A varies equally for all-to-all interaction, but for shorter ranges $\expval{\hat{S}^z}$ decays rapidly with decrease in spin interaction ranges ($\beta >0$) as well as with increase in relative distance from jounction between the regions A $\&$ B. We have added this discussion in detail in section(3) page no.12 and from line no. 238 to the end of the section.
			
		In order to get a general comprehension over the stability of DTC-DMBL chimeralike order, we extended our investigations for a large set of $\epsilon_A$ and $\epsilon_B$ and calculated regional magnetization $M^z_A$ and $M^z_B$ at CDT/DL point for selected $\beta$'s and coupling strengths. We have plotted the obtained $M^z_{A,B}$ values in figure(8) in page no.15. We observe that $\epsilon_A$ and $\epsilon_B$ are the key element to control over the stability and selection of DTC and DMBL phases in regions. At extreme opposite condition when $\epsilon_A \sim 0$ and $\epsilon_B\sim1.0$ the DTC-DMBL chimera is most stable. When $\epsilon_B$ is considered for smaller values (<0.9) maintaining a constant $\epsilon_A = 0.03$, we observe that both of the region gains melting DTC phase with gradual decrease in $\epsilon_B$ (see panels-a,b,c,d). We have investigated also for the cases when $\epsilon_A\sim\epsilon_B$ which are found not to exhibit the DTC-DMBL chimeralike order. Interestingly, when we consider a fixed $\epsilon_B=0.1$ and increase $\epsilon_A$ we observe DMBL in region A and DTC in region B at extreme opposite case when $\epsilon_A=0.1$ and $\epsilon_B=0.9$. We have included this discussion in the revised manuscript in section '4.1. Regional Magnetization' on page 14 from line number 294 to 336.

		\item The referee comments on, \comment{``\underline{Higher root of Bessel function and stability of chimera states:}"}\\
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \comment{``The paper introduces a higher root of the Bessel function without explicitly justifying its significance. The importance of this higher root and its relevance to the stability
				of chimera states need clarification. How does the selection of a higher root impact the system's behavior, and why is it crucial for the observed dynamics?"}\\
			
			\response{We thank the referee to point out the mistake. To obtain DMBL in $T_2$ cycle, the drive parameters should be considered in a manner that the ratio $\frac{4h}{\omega}$ is one of the roots of Bessel function $\mathcal{J}_0\left(\frac{4h}{\omega}\right)$ which is denoted as `CDT/DL point' as discussed in Appendix-A. There is no restriction on selection over the root of the Bessel function regarding CDT/DL point. We have corrected this issue by defining `CDT/DL point' corresponding to the first root of $\mathcal{J}_0\left(\frac{4h}{\omega}\right)$ at page no,\ref{Put the page number line number etc.} and maintained it through out in the manuscript and updated all the figures in revised manuscript with no change in results with comparison to the earlier manuscript. 
			}\\
			\item \comment{``Moreover, the statement “The stability of the chimera order diminishes even if there is a minor deviation from the CDT/DL point” (page 15, lines 43-44) implies that chimera states might not be stable under slight deviations from the CDT/DL point. This raises a critical question regarding the practical implementation of creating chimera states in experiments. To address this, it would be valuable for the paper to explore potential techniques or strategies aimed at stabilizing the DMBL part of the chain. Elaborating on practical considerations and potential solutions would enhance the paper's applicability and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed model."}\\
			
			\response{We thank the referee for the comment. We have considered the drive parameter ratio $\frac{4h}{\omega}$ at fixed to CDT/DL point (which we have chosen to be the first root of the Bessel function for our numerical simulations) which is 2.4048 and the point away from CDT/DL we considered to be 6.0 which is $\sim0.40$ value differ from its closest Bessel function root ($\mathcal{J}_4 =6.3802$). At this point DMBL as well as chimeralike state is unstable. This deviation $~0.40$ is a major deviation from any CDT/DL point. So our claim on instability of chimeralike order at minor deviation in earlier manuscript was incorrect. The minor deviation should be smaller than this regarding the scale of drive parameter ratio. 
				
			To investigate the stability of chimeralike order around the CDT/DL point we have introduced a minor deviation($\Delta_h$) in range between $\in[-0.05, 0.05]$ to the drive amplitude (h) which corresponds to the CDT/DL point at constant drive frequency $\omega = 20$. We also considered the spins are all up polarized initially and system size to be N=8 and $\beta=0$. One can consider otherwise $\beta$'s; however that would necessitate larger system size which spans larger matrices in product space. We numerically evolve the system for a few time cycles upto 20T and calculate the fidelity ($F_n = \abs{\braket{\psi(0)}{\psi (20T)}}^2$) which measures the closeness of the initial state  to the state of the system at 20T. We have plotted $F_n$ for different $\frac{4\Delta_h}{\omega}$ in figure below. The minor deviation region is filled with gray color. 
			\begin{figure}[h!]
				\begin{center}
					\includegraphics[width=10cm]{./figs/figure14.pdf}
				\end{center}
				\caption{Fidelity is plotted against several deviation values $\frac{4\Delta_h}{\omega}$ for different system size (N). The CDT/DL point is denoted by gray dashed line where $\frac{4\Delta_h}{\omega}=0$. Weak (a-panel) and strong (b-panel) is considered. The fidelity is found to be enough large around CDT/DL point (gray-colored region).}
				\label{Fig:aroundCDT}
			\end{figure}
			We found that $F_n$ is sufficiently large ($>0.85$) around the CDT/DL point for both of the spin coupling strengths. We have revised the manuscript at section 4.4 by replacing the sentence ``...even if there is a minor devation..." with ``... at significant deviation..." at page no.20,line no. 403. Additionally we have discussed this issue at Appendix-C at page no.28.

		\item The referee comments on, \comment{``\underline{DTC phase stability and entanglement entropy:}"}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \comment{``The paper seems to be intended for an audience from DTC and MBL/DMBL fields. However, for broader accessibility and comprehension, a brief introductory paragraph about realization and fundamental aspects of DTC within DMBL
			systems would be beneficial. How is DTC defined in these systems, and what are its fundamental properties? Additionally, how is $\omega$ chosen in relation to the periodicity of the Hamiltonian? Moreover, a preliminary explanation of how analyzing the time evolution of local magnetization and its FFT contributes to defining DTC would greatly enhance reader comprehension."}\\
		
			\response{ plan to write at the last ... 
			}
			\item \comment{``It is important to clarify the results shown in Fig. 7, where the behavior of regional magnetization might confuse new readers in the DTC field. This figure suggests that regional magnetization decreases over time under strong coupling and all-to-all interactions, which at the first glance seems to contradict the main text’s assertion that these conditions correspond to stable chimera states. Therefore, a comment  explaining how the magnetization relates to FFT based on the results would be helpful for correctly understanding the results."}\\
			
			\response{
			We thank the referee for the comment. In the figure the reginal magnetization for all-to-all interaction and strong coupling  decreases over time upto very large time 2000T in figure(9) in revised manuscript. In the earlier sections and results depicts that all-to-all interaction is the best suitable choice of spin interaction range for a stable chimeralike order and these results were based on finite large time upto 80T.
			
			In the FFT plot corresponding to the $M^z_A$ results are for very large time upto 2000T. The most dominant frequency is 0.5. However there are other frequencies exist in the FFT spectrum although their dominance (depends on second power of corresponding amplitude) is weaker than $\Omega/\omega=0.5$. For all-to-all interaction range, there is almost no significant frequency available expect at $\Omega/\omega=0.5$ for weak coupling. This manifests a stable chimera even at 2000T. However in case of strong coupling, other frequencies contributing larger FFT amplitudes affect the dynamics due to  $\Omega/\omega=0.5$. This contrasts the stability of chimeralike order in between  weak and strong coupling for the system of finite size N=8.

			We have elaborated our discussion on decrease in stability at strong coupling in the revised manuscript at page 17 and updated the FFT plot (figure 10 in revised manuscript) containing log-scale plot as inset figure and natural scale plot as the primary figure for better comprehension of the readers.
			\item \comment{``There appears to be inconsistency in the analysis of EE and regional magnetisation along with FFT. EE is shown for almost two times longer dynamics that regional magnetization and FFT. Could the authors provide a comparison of regional  magnetization and its FFT for the extended time frames considered for entanglement entropy?"}\\
			
			\response{We thank the referee for pointing out the mistake. We have extended our numerical simulation for regional magnetization and corresponding FFT upto 2000T in order to keep consistency in analysis of EE and regional magnetization. We have updated figures(9) $\&$(10) in the revised manuscript.

		\item The referee comments on, \comment{``\underline{Applications of chimera state:} The introduction of Section 4 briefly touches upon applications of chimera states, but it lacks depth. How can the chimera state findings be applied in practice? Expanding on potential applications and providing references to existing literature will be beneficial. This would enrich the discussion and highlight the practical relevance of their findings."}

	\noindent \textbf{Response to the Referee: 3's comment}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The referee says, \comment{``My main concern is regarding the context in which the word “chimera” has been used
			in this work. The word chimera was originally used for the co-existence of synchronized and unsynchronized dynamics of coupled “identical” oscillators in the “Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 174102 (2004)” which was initially discovered in the following
			works “Y. Kuramoto and D. Battogtokh, Nonlinear Phenom. Complex Syst. 5, 380 (2002), S. I. Shima and Y. Kuramoto, Phys. Rev. E 69, 036213 (2004)”. The surprise that led to the discovery of the chimera state resided in the fact that all the
			subsystems were identical and were subjected to the same environment but behaved differently only due to different initial configurations. But in this and the earlier work mentioned by authors “Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 120606 (2021)”, regions A and B are under different drive conditions. Hence, the spins in these regions are not under identical environments. In such a configuration, it is trivial that both regions can behave differently since they are subjected to different drive conditions. Hence, this co-existence of different phases under inhomogeneous drive conditions for different
			regions does not fall under the novel phenomenon of “chimera”.\\
			
			I understand that this issue arises due to the fact that the related work “Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 120606 (2021)” has referred to this phenomenon as a “chimera state”, even though one of the authors from the same paper has used the definition of the identical oscillator in their earlier work “Phys. Rev. E 92, 062924 (2015)”. Therefore, I request the authors either remove the word chimera completely or use the word “chimeralike state” which has been used in the work “Phys. Rev. E 103, 012214 (2021)” where authors have discovered a chimeralike state in almost-identical oscillators. Along with this, authors should provide a clear distinction that the definition of “chimeralike state” used in this work differs from the definition involving identical oscillators and follows from the earlier work “Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 120606 (2021)” and “Phys. Rev. E 103, 012214” which involve non-identical systems. I
			suppose this is crucial to avoid misunderstandings and further confusion about the novel “Chimera State” for the readers of this reputed journal."}\\
		
		\item The referee says, \comment{``Adding to the previous point on chimera-like states, it would be interesting to see if
			the chimera state emerges even for almost the same drive conditions for regions A
			and B, i.e. for $\epsilon A \approx \epsilon B$ where they only differ by a small value."}\\
		\item The referee says, \comment{``Authors can also investigate the onset of the chimera state as a function of $\epsilon A$ - $\epsilon B$."}\\
		\item The referee says, \comment{``To avoid confusion, the 45th line of Page 2 should be modified to indicate that the concept of “time crystal” was introduced by Frank Wilczek, not just the Discrete time crystals."}\\
		\item The referee says, \comment{``$J_0$ is not defined after equation 7 in the main text."}\\
